        The initial amount provided can be thought of as this => 10 A * 10 B = 100 (Lets say the reserve currency is USDT).
        - The user comes and wants to buy 5 of Token A (Note token A is more expensive than token be. So 5 of AToken = 10 BToken) So the new pool balance is 5 ATok * 20 BTok = 100USDT
        - How can this pool be balanced:  
            - Arbitrage 
            - Incentivize users to buy more of A in return for higher LP tokens
                - (LP tokens can be traded for either protocol votes or other assets)
            - Automatic rebalancing (If Atok falls below a cetain value then sell some of Btok to replenish Atok)
            - Sliding scale LP token rewards based on ratios provided for pool
                - e.g 5 LP tokens for 1:1 ratio, 10 LP tokens for 2:1, and 15 LP tokens for for a 3:1 ratio. 
                - The above scales can be implemented based on the need for the assets and how many protocol tokens are left to back the LP tokens. LP tokens can also be backed by other assets held in reserve by the protocol. 
                - Other incentives such as Governance tokens can also be offered as a reward
